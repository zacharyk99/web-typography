            <h1>Eragon</h1>

            <p>Eragon is the first book in The Inheritance Cycle by American fantasy writer Christopher Paolini. Paolini, born in 1983, began writing the novel after graduating from highschool at age fifteen. After writing the first draft for a year, Paolini
                spent a second year rewriting and fleshing out the story and characters. His parents saw the final manuscript and in 2001 decided to self-publish Eragon;[2] Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel. The
                book was discovered by novelist Carl Hiaasen, who got it re-published by Alfred A. Knopf. The re-published version was released on August 26, 2003.</p>

            <p>The book tells the story of a farm boy named Eragon, who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains. The stone is revealed to be a dragon egg, and a dragon he later names Saphira hatches from it. When the evil King Galbatorix finds out about
                the egg, he sends monstrous servants to acquire it, making Eragon and Saphira flee from their hometown with a storyteller named Brom. Brom, an old member of an extinct group called the Dragon Riders, teaches Eragon about 'The Ways of the
                Rider.'
            </p>

            <p>Eragon was the third-best-selling children's hardback book of 2003, and the second-best-selling paperback of 2005. It placed on the New York Times Children's Books Best Seller list for 121 weeks and was adapted as a feature film of the same
                name that was released on December 15, 2006.</p>

            <h2>Plot summary</h2>
            <p>A Shade named Durza, along with a group of Urgals, ambushes a party of three elves. They kill two of them, and Durza attempts to steal an egg carried by the remaining female elf, but she uses magic to teleport it elsewhere. Infuriated, he
                abducts her.
            </p>

            <p>Eragon is a fifteen-year-old boy who has lived with his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran on a farm near the village of Carvahall, left there by his mother Selena after his birth. While hunting, the dragon egg appears in front of him. The night
                after, a baby dragon hatches from the egg, and bonds with Eragon. Eragon names the dragon Saphira, after a name the old village storyteller Brom mentions.</p>

            <p>He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira escape and hide in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the farm is burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies,
                Eragon and Saphira decide to hunt the Ra'zac, in vengeance. Brom insists on accompanying him and Saphira, and gives Eragon the sword Zar'roc.</p>

            <p>Eragon becomes a Dragon Rider, through his bond with Saphira. He is the only known Rider in Alagaësia other than King Galbatorix, who, with the help of the now-dead Forsworn, a group of rogue Riders, killed every other Rider a century ago.
                As they travel, Brom teaches Eragon sword fighting, magic, the ancient elvish language, and the ways of the Dragon Riders.</p>

            <p>They travel to the city of Teirm, where they meet with Brom's friend Jeod. Eragon's fortune is told by the witch Angela, and her companion, the werecat Solembum, gives Eragon mysterious advice. With Jeod's help, they track the Ra'zac to the
                city of Dras-Leona. They manage to infiltrate the city, but are forced to flee after a run-in with the Ra'zac. That night, they are ambushed by the Ra'zac. A stranger named Murtagh rescues them, but Brom is mortally wounded. Brom gives
                Eragon his blessing, reveals that he was once a Dragon Rider, with a dragon named Saphira, and dies. Saphira uses magic to encase Brom in a diamond tomb.</p>

            <p>Murtagh becomes Eragon's new companion and they travel to the city of Gil'ead, seeking information on how to find the Varden, a group of rebels who seek the downfall of Galbatorix. Near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in a jail
                that holds a female elf he had had recurring dreams about. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon takes the unconscious elf with him. After fighting Durza, Murtagh seemingly kills him with an arrow shot through his head, and they
                escape. Eragon telepathically communicates with the elf, named Arya, who reveals she had sent the egg to him accidentally. From her, he learns the location of the Varden. Murtagh is reluctant to journey to the Varden, revealing that he
                is the son of Morzan, former leader of the Forsworn.</p>

            <p>An army of Kull, elite Urgals, chases Eragon to the Varden's headquarters, but is driven off by the Varden, who escort Eragon, Saphira, Murtagh, and Arya to Farthen Dûr, their mountain hideout. Eragon meets the leader of the Varden, Ajihad.
                Ajihad imprisons Murtagh after he refuses to allow his mind to be read, to determine his allegiance. Eragon is told by Ajihad that Murtagh failed to kill Durza, as the only way to kill a Shade is with a stab through the heart. Orik, nephew
                of the dwarf King Hrothgar, is appointed as Eragon and Saphira's guide. Eragon also meets Ajihad's daughter, Nasuada, and Ajihad's right-hand man, Jörmundur. He runs into Angela and Solembum again, and visits Murtagh in prison. He is tested
                by two magicians, The Twins, as well as Arya.</p>

            <p>Eragon and the Varden are then attacked by an immense Urgal army. Eragon personally battles Durza again, and, after a mental battle, is overwhelmed by Durza, who slashes him across the back. Arya and Saphira shatter Isidar Mithrim, a large
                sapphire that formed the roof of the chamber, to distract Durza, allowing Eragon to stab him through the heart with his sword. He falls into a coma, and is visited telepathically by a stranger, who tells Eragon to visit him in the Elven
                capital, Ellesméra. He wakes up with a scar across his back, and resolves to journey to Ellesméra.</p>

            <h2>Major characters</h2>
            <h3>Eragon Bromsson</h3>
            <p>the human son of Brom and Selena, although Eragon's true relationship to Brom is not revealed until the third novel. Eragon is the cousin of Roran Garrowsson and half-brother of Murtagh. Until the age of fifteen, he was raised by his uncle
                Garrow. After the dragon Saphira hatches for him, he travels to the Varden, where he learns of the evils done by Galbatorix and determines to end the king's rule. He has romantic feelings for the elf Arya, but the two never become a couple
                as he leaves Alagaësia permanently at the end of the final novel. He is also known as Eragon Bromsson, Argetlam, Shur'tugal, Shadeslayer, Firesword, and Kingkiller.</p>

            <h3>Saphira Bjartskular ("Brightscales")</h3>
            <p>a female blue dragon who hatches from an egg stolen from Galbatorix by Brom and Jeod. She is the last living female dragon in all of Alagaësia, although more dragon eggs are found at the end of the final novel. Saphira is wise, fearless, protective
                of Eragon, and somewhat vain. She is also skilled at aerial acrobatics. Her sire was Iormûngr, a bonded dragon, and her dam was Vervanda, a wild dragon. At the end of Inheritance she mates with Fírnen before leaving Alagaësia with Eragon.</p>

            <h3>Arya Dröttningu</h3>
            <p>a female elf and is the only daughter of King Evandar and Queen Islanzadí. Arya has served as courier of Saphira's egg and the elves' ambassador to the Varden.[6] She becomes queen of the elves after the death of her mother, as well as a dragon
                rider (bonded to Fírnen), at the end of the final book. She is also known as Arya Svit-kona and Arya Shadeslayer. Eragon rescues her in the first novel when she is being held captive by Durza, a shade. When Eragon first pursues her romantically,
                she rebuffs his advances, telling him she had recently lost a close friend, Fäolin, and that any relationship would be unwise because of their respective responsibilities and age differences. She holds traditional human gender roles in
                disdain.[12] At the end of the final novel, she is willing to consider Eragon as a romantic partner, but he leaves before they can begin a relationship. She shows this by telling her true name to Eragon, which she refused to do before.</p>

            <h3>Murtagh Morzansson</h3>
            <p>the human son of Morzan and Selena, Eragon's half-brother. Eragon first meets him in Eragon and travels with him to the Varden, where he is mistrusted for being Morzan's son. In Eldest, Murtagh is kidnapped by the Twins and forced to serve
                Galbatorix after the dragon Thorn hatches for him. He is an exceptionally skilled swordsman naturally, and has enhanced strength and magic from Galbatorix, as well as his Eldunarí (the source of a dragon's being and life force). Due to
                his difficult childhood, he has little empathy for others. He has romantic feelings for Nasuada, but does not pursue a relationship as he feels he can never be accepted by society, even after helping to defeat Galbatorix.[9] His name is
                entirely the author's invention.</p>

            <h3>Galbatorix</h3>
            <p>the human king and tyrant of the Empire. When his first dragon, Jarnunvösk was killed by Urgals, Galbatorix began a quest for revenge against the Riders which ultimately resulted in their extinction and his rise to power in the human kingdom.
                He stole a dragon hatchling named Shruikan and bound their minds in a crude approximation of a Rider's bond. He has derived incredible magical strength from the captured souls of dead dragons, the Eldunarí. He is at least 120 years old.
                He is killed in the final novel. Galbatorix's name means "Big King" in Celtic.</p>

            <h3>Nasuada</h3>
            <p>the daughter of Ajihad and Nadara, human members of the Wandering Tribes. Upon her father's death at the beginning of Eldest, Nasuada becomes leader of the Varden. She is Eragon's liegelord. She is very cunning and trusted by both her people
                and Eragon, which leads her to become queen of the Empire in Inheritance. Her later decision to force all magic-users to register and be monitored by the government is what drives Eragon to leave Alagaësia.</p>

            <h3>Roran Garrowsson (Stronghammer)</h3>
            <p>Eragon's cousin and father of Ismira, who grew up with him in Carvahall with Eragon. Roran has an almost obsession with his eventual-wife, Katrina, which leads him to travel with the whole of Carvahall to join the Varden. He becomes an excellent
                motivational speaker as a result. Although he at first resents his cousin for inciting war and bringing about Garrow's death, the two make up and become quite close.</p>

            <h3>Orik Thrifksson (also known as Grimstborith Orik and King Orik)</h3>
            <p>a dwarf, a member of the clan Dûrgrimst Ingeitum, and the nephew of King Hrothgar. He becomes king and leader (Grimstborith) of Ingeitum after Hrothgar's death. Orik is a smith, a warrior, and Eragon's guide. He adopts Eragon into his clan
                in Eldest. Orik later marries Hvedra, the Grimstcarvlorss of Ingeitum.</p>

            <h2>Adaptations</h2>
            <h3>Film</h3>
            <p>A film adaptation of Eragon was released in the United States on December 15, 2006. Plans to create the film were first announced in February 2004, when 20th Century Fox purchased the rights to Eragon. The film was directed by first-timer
                Stefen Fangmeier, and written by Peter Buchman.</p>

            <p>Edward Speleers was selected for the role of Eragon. Over the following months, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Chris Egan and Djimon Hounsou were all confirmed as joining the cast. Principal photography for the film took place in Hungary and
                Slovakia.
            </p>

            <p>The film received mostly negative reviews, garnering a 16% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes; the tenth worst of 2006. The Seattle Times described it as "technically accomplished, but fairly lifeless and at times a bit silly". The Hollywood
                Reporter said the world of Eragon was "without much texture or depth". The story was labelled "derivative" by The Washington Post, and "generic" by the Las Vegas Weekly. Newsday stressed this point further, asserting that only "nine-year-olds
                with no knowledge whatsoever of any of the six Star Wars movies" would find the film original. The acting was called "lame" by the Washington Post, as well as "stilted" and "lifeless" by the Orlando Weekly. The dialogue was also criticized:
                MSNBC labelled it "silly"; the Las Vegas Weekly called it "wooden". Positive reviews described the film as "fun" and "the stuff boys' fantasies are made of". The CGI work was called "imaginative" and Saphira was called a "magnificent creation".
                Paolini stated he enjoyed the film, particularly praising the performances of Jeremy Irons and Ed Speleers.</p>

            <p>Eragon grossed approximately $75 million in the United States and $173.9 million elsewhere, totaling $249 million worldwide. It is the fifth highest-grossing film with a dragon at its focal point ,and the sixth highest-grossing film of the
                sword and sorcery subgenre. Eragon was in release for seventeen weeks in the United States, opening on December 15, 2006 and closing on April 9, 2007. It opened in 3,020 theaters, earning $8.7 million on opening day and $23.2 million across
                opening weekend, ranking second behind The Pursuit of Happyness. Eragon's $75 million total United States gross was the thirty-first highest for 2006. The film earned $150 million in its opening weekend across 76 overseas markets, making
                it the #1 film worldwide. The film's $249 million total worldwide gross was the sixteenth highest for 2006.</p>

            <h3>Video game</h3>
            <p>A video game adaptation of Eragon based primarily on the film, released in North America on November 14, 2006. The game is a third-person video game released for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, developed by Stormfront
                Studios. Also released are unique versions of Eragon for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, and mobile phone handheld gaming systems, primarily developed by Amaze Entertainment. The console and PC versions of the
                game are very similar, focusing on the same style of gameplay. However, the Xbox 360 edition features two exclusive levels. One is on foot as Eragon, and Saphira is controlled in the second mission.</p>

            <p>The game has received generally negative reviews usually receiving press averages around the 4-6 out of 10 region (or the equivalent, 45-55 out of 100) according to review aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings. The combined sales in
                North America were over 400,000 copies.</p>

            <p>The majority of the game is taken up by third-person combat, usually on foot. Some missions permit the player to use the dragon Saphira in combat. The gameplay mechanics within these levels are largely similar to those in ground-based levels,
                with the exception of some different attack moves (such as tail attacks). Protagonist Eragon sits on Saphira's back during these sections, and can be made to fire magic arrows. The player has no choice as to whether or not they use Saphira.
                Similarly, the player cannot use Saphira in ground-based levels: they can call for her and she will swoop past, but it is not possible to use this feature to ride Saphira. There is a multiplayer co-op mode which allows two people to play
                through the main storyline. It is possible to switch from playing a one-player game to a two-player game at any time. There are no Internet multiplayer options.</p>
